      "When opening the terminal you are in the home directory, the command \"cd\" will take you here, and the command \"ls\" lists out all the folders, files, etc. in this directory.  The list generated by \"ls\" is in a default format and color scheme.  Now, the command \"ls -F\" will generate the list in the format we want, however this is combersome, so we will want to now change the command \"ls\" to be shorthand for \"ls -F\" which can be done with the command 'alias ls \"/bin/ls -F\"'.  Now the command ls has the correct format, but the list is no longer colored, so we need to add more to our \"alias\" command.  We can again type 'alias ls \"/bin/ls -F --color=auto\"' and the ls comand is now both formatted correctly, and has the correct color.  However, this is completely local to this terminal tab, if we open a new tab, the it will have the default formatting, to fix this we can write to the \".cshrc\" file, which has a set of commands that are carried out when a new terminal tab is opened.  We can use the text editor \"emacs\" to do this by tryping \"emacs .cshrc\" which will open the \".cshrc\" file where we can save the command 'alias ls \"/bin/ls -F --color=auto\"' and now every new tab we open will have this formatting."
