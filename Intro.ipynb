      "When opening the terminal you are in the home directory, the command \"cd\" will take you here, and the command \"ls\" lists out all the folders, files, etc. in this directory.  The list generated by \"ls\" is in a default format and color scheme.  Now, the command \"ls -F\" will generate the list in the format we want, however this is combersome, so we will want to now change the command \"ls\" to be shorthand for \"ls -F\" which can be done with the command 'alias ls \"/bin/ls -F\"'.  Now the command ls has the correct format, but the list is no longer colored, so we need to add more to our \"alias\" command.  We can again type 'alias ls \"/bin/ls -F --color=auto\"' and the ls comand is now both formatted correctly, and has the correct color.  However, this is completely local to this terminal tab, if we open a new tab, the it will have the default formatting, to fix this we can write to the \".cshrc\" file, which has a set of commands that are carried out when a new terminal tab is opened.  We can use the text editor \"emacs\" to do this by tryping \"emacs .cshrc\" which will open the \".cshrc\" file where we can save the command 'alias ls \"/bin/ls -F --color=auto\"' and now every new tab we open will have this formatting."

Now, you can create a repository, named it pythonIntro for the sake of these directions.  We now need to allow the computer we are working on acces to the github server, by generating a key to give to server which can be done by typing the command \"ssh-keygen\", the terminal will then ask what file to save the key in, do this in \"/astro/users/[username]/.ssh/id_rsa\" and press enter when the terminal asks for a passphrase for simplicity.  Your key will now be generated.  Type in the command \"cat /astro/users/[username]/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\" to display the key by itself.  Now you must go to your account on github and add a deploy key.  This is done by entering the repository and clicking on settings, then Deploy keys, and finally add deploy key.  Copy the key from the terminal and paste it into the section on the website that asks for it.  Now you can check out data from the website to the account you are working on, simply open the repository and in the quick setup tab click \"ssh\" , then copy the string in the text box and type, in Terminal, the command \"git clone [string from text box]\" and now they are linked."

Once this is finished, open a new terminal window and navigate to the downloads directory.  Once here type the command \"bash ./ Anaconda[tab]\" as the tab will autocomplete the file name.  Follow the instruction in the terminal for instalation.  Agree to the what the terminal askes.  When finished type the command \"cat /astro/users/[username]/.bashrc\" this will give you the path you must add to the \".cshrc\" file in order to access ipython in each terminal window you open.  Now go to that file and add a line 'sentenv PATH \"/astro/users/[username]/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"'. We are now done.  To check, when typing the command \"which ipython\" it should point to the exicutable \"/astro/users/[username]/anaconda/bin/ipython\".
